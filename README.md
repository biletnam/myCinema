Internal Website for a movie theater

Hi everyone! 

My first PHP/mySQL project. 
We had to create an internal website for a movie theater.
We also had to create a searching section for movies and members. 
In regards to the searching section for movies we had to create some filter to find a specify movie so you can search with those filters : 
name / distributor / kind of movie

In regards to the searching section for members we had to create some filter to find a specify member so you can search with those filters   name / surname

According to the subject, we had to implement a subscription system and an admin panel where you can delete an user, modify his subscribe and look for his history.

Next to it, we can add a specifing comment for one of those movies the user saw.
